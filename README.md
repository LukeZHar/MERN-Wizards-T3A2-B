## Technologies Used
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for flexible data storage and retrieval.
- **Express:** Web application framework for Node.js to build RESTful APIs.
- **React:** JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **MUI:** Material-UI component library used to design user interfaces following Material Design principles, enhancing responsiveness and aesthetics.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Development environment providing features like integrated terminal, debugging, and various extensions tailored for JavaScript and React development.
- **GitHub Desktop:** A GUI for Git that simplifies version control, making it easier to manage repositories and collaborate within the team.


## Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Utilises JWT for secure user authentication, enabling users to log in and manage their tasks with individual accounts, ensuring data security and user privacy.
- **Task Management:** Users can create, edit, and delete tasks with the ability to categorise and prioritise them based on urgency, helping them stay organised and focused.
- **Admin Panel:** Admins can manage user accounts, including updating roles, deleting users, and overseeing task activities, granting administrators the oversight necessary for smooth operation.
- **Responsive Design:** Built using Material-UI (MUI), the application provides an attractive and consistent user interface across all devices, enhancing accessibility for users.

## Installation
1. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LukeZHar/MERN-Wizards-T3A2-B.git
   cd MERN-Wizards-T3A2-B
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
	```bash
	npm install
	```

3. Create a .env file in the root directory and populate it with environment variables:
	```text
	PORT=8008
	DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/<your_database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
	JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
	VITE_AUTH_API_URL=https://your_api_url
	```
	- **DATABASE_URL:** Replace **username**, **password**, and **your_database** with your MongoDB Atlas credentials.
	- **JWT_SECRET:** Set this to a strong, confidential string used for signing JWT tokens.
	- **VITE_AUTH_API_URL:** Set this to your deployed API endpoint or local development URL as needed.

4. Start the Application:
To run the application, use the following command to start both the backend and frontend together:
	```bash
	npm run dev
	```
	- This should be set in your package.json to start both servers concurrently.

## Deployment
- **Render:** The application is deployed on Render for server-side operations, which hosts the backend API securely and provides scalability.
- **MongoAtlas:** For the database, we utilised MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based solution that allows for efficient and secure data management with features like automated backups and high availability.
- **Netlify:** The frontend of the application is deployed on Netlify, which provides rapid, continuous deployment capabilities and optimized performance for web applications. Visit A Ticket a Task It to access the live application.

## Security Measures
- **Helmet.js:** Employed to set secure HTTP headers and protect against common vulnerabilities.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Implemented for secure communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring user authentication and authorisation by encoding user information and preventing tampering.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** Configured to control which domains can access the resources on our server, preventing unauthorized domains from making requests to our API.
- **Error Handling:** Developed comprehensive error-handling mechanisms to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages, thus protecting backend logic and data integrity.

## User Testing
- **Development Testing:** 
	- **Unit Testing:** Testing individual components or functions to ensure they behave as expected. This is often automated using testing frameworks (Vitest).
	- **Integration Testing:** Testing how different modules interact with each other, ensuring that combined parts function correctly together.
	- **Manual Testing:** Manually test application features to validate user stories and functionality.
	- **Feedback Iteration:** Gathering feedback from team members during development to make iterative improvements based on testing results.
- **Production Testing:** 
	- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Simulated real users and tested the application to validate the functionality based on requirements and expectations.
	- **Performance Testing:** Assessing how the application performs under various loads, identifying potential bottlenecks, and ensuring stability and speed.
	- **End-to-End Testing:** Testing the complete flow of the application from start to finish to verify that all components are functioning correctly together in the production environment.
	- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitoring the application for any issues, bugs, or performance metrics after it goes live.

## Testing Framework
- **Unit and Integration Testing:** 
  - The project utilises **Vitest** as the formal testing framework, along with **Testing Library** for React components. A comprehensive test suite has been established, covering both unit tests for individual components and integration tests for overall functionality.

## Task Management
The project utilised **Trello** for task management, allowing our team to efficiently organise, prioritise, and track tasks. Tasks were assigned based on team strengths and availability, ensuring a smooth workflow and effective collaboration throughout the project lifecycle.

## Code Quality
- **DRY Principles:** The codebase exemplifies DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principles, ensuring that every piece of functionality or logic has a single, authoritative representation throughout the project.
- **Code Flow Control:** Flawless code flow is demonstrated by a logical and seamless execution path for all user stories, providing a structured user experience.
- **Object-Oriented Principles:** Object-oriented patterns, such as modular design and encapsulation, have been applied to enhance the application's maintainability and serviceability, resulting in cleaner code that is easier to understand and modify.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with Google OAuth:** Plan to implement Google authentication for easier user registration and login.
- **Notification System:** Enhancements to the current notification system, aiming for real-time alerts for user interactions.
- **JIRA Integration:** Investigating options for integrating JIRA card functionalities to track progress of tasks directly within the application interface.
- **Testing Framework Expansion:** Expanding the test suite to cover more components to ensure robustness, with the goal of achieving 100% code coverage.
